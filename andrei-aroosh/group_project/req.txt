Congrats on finishing the map, now you must use it in your main.py file.

1: Import the map module, and use it in a game
2: Make a simple game, character is stuck on a 4x4 island
3: Allow character to move up down left right
4: Allow character to explore current space for treasure
5: Randomly spread out treasure on map
